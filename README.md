Space invaders clone scene created for my computer graphics assignment.
Not an actual clone of the full game but rather and introduction to creating a 2D scene using the three.js library.

Implementations:
-3D text objects using the FontLoader library for scores, lives left
- 'Stars' generation using a random coords generator function and PointsMaterial objects
- BoxGeometrys created for various objects in the scene
- Custom shapes created using Shape objects
- Ability to move the cannon left/right with arrow keys
- Translations and rotations applied to aliens for movement in scene

Learned how to implement different things using the three.js library, setting me up for future assignments and personal projects.
